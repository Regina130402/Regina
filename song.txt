добавил(-а) первую половину моей любимой песни
All that I want
>Is to wake up fine
>Tell me that I'm alright
>That I ain't gonna die 

All that I want
Is a hole in the ground
You can tell me when it's alright
For me to come out
gonna make you wonder why you even try
 Hard times gonna take you down and laugh when you cry 
 Hard times gonna take you down and laugh when you cry 
 Where I've become so numb Without a soul
 Where I've become so numb Without a soul
